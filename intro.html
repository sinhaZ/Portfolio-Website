          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I have completed my B.Sc. in computer science and engineering at
            United International University. My final year project was “Real
            time face recognition with and without a mask'' which recognizes a
            person with or without a face mask using a machine learning
            algorithm deep convolutional neural network in python and made a
            compact hardware model to use it. I also have experience with
            frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, SciPy,
            NumPy, Pandas, etc. by doing my final year project. I also have
            experience with JavaScript, C, HTML, MySQL, Java, git, and GitHub.
            Our team got 1st prize in a project called “Water Cleaning Boat”
            which cleans surface waste of water using a boat. I am always eager
            to learn and adapt to new technologies and also like to solve
            problems, prioritization, and organize. I would describe myself as a
            multi-tasker, efficient and enthusiastic, and also good at
            communicating. I am also a quick learner and have analytical and
            problem-solving skills. My research interests are machine learning,
            deep learning, and bioinformatics.
